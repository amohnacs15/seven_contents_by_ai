Long ago during World War II, desperate times called for an unlikely hero. A small bear cub was adopted by a Polish Army unit known as the 22nd Company. 'Vojtek' 🐻, which means “Happy Warrior”, proved invaluable to the troops in 1944 by lifted objects too heavy for any man and cheering the men on along the way with his playful antics. 

But regulations prevented animals to join them during the battles, so these soldiers worked around that difficulty by officially drafting Vojtek into the Army and giving him the rank 'Private.’ What a transformation! 

At the end of the war he was sent to the Edinburgh Zoo, where he showed immense loyalty and continuously visited by tourists, journalists, and his fellow soldier companions. Eventually, he passed away peacefully of natural causes in 1965. 

This is a story of courage, loyalty, and friendship - one that must be shared and remembered. Head on over and be inspired! 😉 Let's keep ‘Happy Warrior’ Vojtek’s special story alive. #RememberVojtek #ForTheAnimals #HappyWarrior #WWII #ItTakesAHero # LoyaltyLiveOn #Vojtek #RealLifeHero #WhyIChooseFurLife

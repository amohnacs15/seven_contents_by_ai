Quiz Question 1:
What is the basic idea of machine learning?
Answer: The basic idea of machine learning is to input data, such as physical attributes into a machine model and use the model to identify good watermelon with percentage surety.

Quiz Question 2:
What can computers now do better than manual methods?
Answer: Computers can now use physical attributes to accurately identify a good watermelon with percentage surety, better than manual methods such as feeling or smelling the watermelon.

Quiz Question 3:
What do you have to do to “train” a machine learning model?
Answer: To “train” a machine learning model, you have to feed the model relevant data over time to show it what good and bad watermelons are.

Quiz Question 4:
What will happen over a 10 year period if you input 10 years of consistent analysis?
Answer: Over a 10 year period, the machine learning model will theoretically be able to use the physical attributes to accurately identify a good watermelon with percentage surety.

Quiz Question 5:
What will the machine model be able to advise you to do when it becomes intelligent enough?
Answer: When the machine model becomes intelligent enough, it will be able to advise you to trust it and use it to select future watermelons.

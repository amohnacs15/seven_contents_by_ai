Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is being used to help determine the quality of a watermelon. Instead of relying on conventional methods such as smell or softness, machine learning includes precise assessment of attributes like the fatness and thiness of the watermelon's stripes. After inputting these attributes into a model, users are then asked to provide feedback on whether the watermelon was good after eating it. This feedback is stored is used for the next 10 years to eventually determine the quality of future watermelons. With this method, one day users will be able to trust the model's assessment and buy high quality watermelon without having to worry about the taste and texture.

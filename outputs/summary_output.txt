Hydro therapy is a form of physical therapy aimed at improving balance, muscle strength and joint flexibility by incorporating the cushioning and resistance from water. It is designed to reduce the risk of falls among elders and those with physical disabilities. Generally, it involves transitioning through a pool of warm salt-water with temperatures ranging from 32-34 degrees Celsius. Hydro therapy requires no more than 45 minutes per session and can take place in three different sized pools. A smaller pool with massage jets and bubbles is suitable for relaxation and resistance training, a medium sized pool is meant for those who are hydrophobic and have difficulty balancing, while a larger pool is ideal for those with greater physical challenges, such as those dealing with pain, impaired motor skills, or paralysis. After six consecutive weeks researchers have noticed clear improvements in the mental and physical stability of the participants. In the future, viewers will discover further exercises that can help improve balance in a safe yet enjoyable manner.

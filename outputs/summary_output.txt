Joe is a retired seventy-year-old man who has a history of smoking and type 2 diabetes, putting him at an increased risk of stroke. This afternoon, that stroke begins with a headache and blurred vision and quickly renders him helpless as he falls. Seven hours later, his daughter finds him and it is too late to be saved. Every year, 800,000 patients have a stroke in the U.S., yet only 10% get to the hospital in time. This leaves the remainder in chronic disability, highlighting the need for Alva Health's continuous stroke monitor, an innovative device that uses two wristbands to detect abnormal weakness on one side of the body - a defining signature of stroke - in time to notify the user and their emergency contacts. It has the potential to not just improve the lives of patients, but also save the healthcare system from significant strain.

This text talks about the use of machine learning to determine whether a watermelon is good or bad. The traditional way to determine this would be to visually check for softness and smell, but machine learning does not require any of that. Instead, attributes such as how fat and thin the stripes are are fed into a machine model that has been trained. With repetition over time, the model can determine whether a watermelon is good by analyzing these attributes and giving a percentage of surety. This means that if the machine model says the watermelon is good, it should be safe to take it home and enjoy.

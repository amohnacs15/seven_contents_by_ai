The text is discussing how a machine learning model can help identify when a watermelon is good or bad. Rather than relying on manual methods such as feeling or smelling the watermelon, one can input physical attributes (e.g. fat or thin stripes) into a machine model that knows nothing. After feeding this information to the machine model, one can eat the watermelon and come back and tell the model if it was indeed a good or bad watermelon. After 10 years of this consistent analysis, the model will theoretically be able to use the physical attributes to accurately identify a good watermelon with percentage surety. Thus, trusting the model, one can use it to select future watermelons.

Machine learning can be applied to the process of selecting a good watermelon. Rather than relying on the traditional methods of pressing the end and smelling it, this process utilises data from the attributes of the specific watermelon such as the width and amount of stripes. This information is given to a "baby" machine model that knows nothing about the selection process. Users tell the model after eating and returning the following day whether it was good or not, allowing the model to build up preferences over the course of 10 years. In this way, the model is able to produce accurate predictions based on the attributes of the watermelon alone and can tell users what percentage chance there is of the watermelon tasting good. This eliminates the need to press, smell and guess, giving users confidence that the watermelon they take home will taste as they expect.

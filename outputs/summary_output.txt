Hydrotherapy, or exercising underwater, is an effective tool for helping to improve balance and mobility in seniors, allowing them to reduce their risk of falling. It provides the benefit of water to support oneâ€™s body weight and relieve pressure on the joints, therefore reducing the risk associated with ground-based exercise. There are three types of swimming pools for hydrotherapy: small jets for relaxation and resistance, medium-sized pools for single person use, and large pools for elders who might struggle to balance or be in pain. Those pools use salt water with a temperature of 32-34 degrees Celsius and sessions normally take only up to 45 minutes. Studies have shown that elders who pursued hydrotherapy for six weeks improved their balance.

In 1942, a group of recently released Polish soldiers, who had been taken prisoner of war during WWII, stumbled across a small
bear cub at a train station in Iran. Genuinely charmed by the bear, they decided to adopt the cub, who they soon named Vojtek, which is a Slavic name meaning ‘happy warrior.’ Vojtek was later adopted by a Polish Army unit known as the 22nd Company and began assimilating quickly into the unit, learning how to drink coffee, salute when greeted and even play jokes.

In 1944 Vojtek's unit was reassigned to fight alongside the British Eighth Army. Unfortunately, regulations of the shipping barges they used to transport to the destination prohibited animals to join them. The soldiers worked their way around this issue by officially drafting Vojtek into the Army and giving him the rank ‘Private.' 

After the war ended in 1945, a new home had to be found for the bear and he was eventually donated to the Edinburgh Zoo. Vojtek quickly proved to be an extremely popular addition and was continuously visited by journalists, tourists and his beloved former solider companions. He loyally spent the rest of his days in this zoo until his death from natural causes in 1965.

In 1942, Polish POWs stumbled across Vojtek, a small bear cub in Iran. They named him “Happy Warrior” & he ultimately joined the 22nd Company. #MilitaryHistory #Vojtek #WWII 

Regulations prohibited animals in transport. Unfazed, Vojtek was officially hired and given the rank ‘Private.’ #DogsofWar #WarHero #WWII 

In 1945 Vojtek found a new home at the Edinburgh Zoo. He was an extremely popular addition. #MilitaryFurrry #EveryoneLovesABear #AbsoluteUnit 

Vojtek loyally spent rest of days in zoo & died from natural causes in 1965. He will be remembered as a war hero. #WWIIMemorial #FamedFourPawWarrior #RememberingVojtek 

No matter his tiny stature, the story of Vojtek shows the power of love & courage during WWII. #Minidoggedness #PolishHero #CutenessOverloaded

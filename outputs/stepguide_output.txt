Step 1: Gather physical attributes on each watermelon such as size, shape, fatness/thinness of rind, presence of pimples, color/variation in dark green stripes.

Step 2: Input this information in the machine learning model.

Step 3: Eat the watermelon and log if itâ€™s good or bad once done.

Step 4: Carefully record the results of each watermelon in the machine learning model.

Step 5: Over time, increase the number of inputs until you have 10 years of consistent data

Step 6: Run analysis models on this data to build a machine learning model which will give insights how often certain attributes is correlated with good or bad watermelon.

Step 7: Building on the machine model, continue specific attributes discovery in different regions and specify a cutting edge model.

Step 8: Assess the accuracy of the model with results from deployed in field tests as conditions may vary and traits considered good/bad may differ from region, season and farmer practice.

Step 9: Gather opinions for one back case scientific trials about characteristics synergy and occurence rates.

Step 10: Repeat data input and across different regions. 

Step 11: Embrace certainty percentage until there the model is able to correctly predict a successful choice of good watermelon with percentage surety.

Step 12: Start using this machine model backed scientifically and regulatorly approved to help select watermelons in the future.

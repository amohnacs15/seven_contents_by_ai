Have you heard the inspiring story of Vojtek ❤? Vojtek was a small bear, who in 1942 was adopted by a group of Polish soldiers setting off to fight during WWII. Their unit was complete and was adopted by the 5nd Company 🇵🇱, and Vojtek with the soliders marched, played jokes and was even given the mandated Officer rank 'Private'.

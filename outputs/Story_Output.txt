Joe had lived a long and full life, marked by good decisions and a few bad ones what everyone makes during their lifetime. Despite it all, Joe was a lover of people; from a young age he had been known to take great pleasure in engaging conversation, especially with the youngest in the bunch.

It was on a rare crystal-clear morning that he had left the house to get some tea. Enjoying the spring air and sunshine, he had no inkling of the devil that was to come knocking. As evening had drawn close, he had returned home with a splitting headache, accompanied by heavy body paralysis and, within only a matter of moments, Joe experienced a stroke, one that left him utterly powerless in the face of its intensity. 

Hours passed and eventually his daughter, surprised by her father's sudden, and unexpected, silence, rushing just in time in attempt to prevent any further distress. Sadly nothing could bring him back to who he was and despite the very best efforts of his caretakers and her limitless love, nothing went to undo the damage that had been done in that irrevocable stroke. 

Though Joe had passed, his life shaped the greater narrative that could be heard through the services of Alva Health and the creation of their continuous stroke monitor. Utilizing an innovative device—which was composed of two wristbands in order to detect signs of a stroke, such as a weakness along one side of the body—could help give people a fighting chance, both saving them and their nearest and dearest from unnecessary anguish. This miracle device could also help ease the pressure from the healthcare system alike. 

Joe’s passing was undoubtedly another instance of senseless tragedy, but it stood for something more than what usually falls through history’s lines. Because of his suffering, an already too-common challenge was ultimately avoided by creating a life-saving device that has been changing the world to this day. Jessie, Joe’s daughter, stands proud and proud believers of the same simplicity that Joe had devoted himself to conduct during his blessed life.

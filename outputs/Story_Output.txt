Joe is a retired seventy-year-old man who chose to thumb his nose at signs of his age, bad habits, and increased risks. Smiling as he enjoys his days in the sunshine, there’s never been a time that his age or weakened state would keep him from doing anything he wanted.

But fate dealt Joe a hand far too powerful to ignore. An unforeseen morning headache and blurred vision signaled the beginning of stroke, his malicious attacker. Joe, unwelcome intruder, had the audacity to visit during the unmonitored hours of morning.

 Knowing not what waited downstairs, Joe’s daughter contacted her mother and they took him to the hospital —speed non-withstanding. His small refuge away was his solely: alerting button - successfully signalling to be send help as soon as it was triggered. 

The ER turnout was a foreboding sight and therein made preparations for a too-late result. Experienced eyes met yet another victim helplessly becoming one of the 800,000 American’s affected by stroke.

This recent tragedy echoed back to our innovator Joe, warning us all to dare a bit more to choice life for ourselves - no one made to suffer needlessly ever again.

Inspired by Joe's plight, Alva Health leapt into actions to create a life-saving novahealth technology – two complex-simple wristbands to detect abnormal weakness on our side of the body, alerting and transporting us with haste to the ER. No longer stationary, chained systems restricted to a clinic, this all-seeing, innovative, free device stands a realm of possibility not only to prevent but to outweigh the harmful effects to come._

Joe was fond of victory and his efforts before have helped to test and engage a product of life lifesaver that could one day save himself or whom he loves.  Joe may have not received another chance, but you and him can have one-- all inscribed on the world and being made accessible to the millions of others at will!

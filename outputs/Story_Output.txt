Magdalena stood at the edge of the pool, tensely gripping the railing as the waters beckoned her onward. She had heard about hydrotherapy and the amazing benefits it promised for her aged joints but the idea of swimming at her age was one that made the elderly woman shudder with fear. Her friends had all promised results and kept spurring her on to edge closer, but she resisted, not yet ready to dive in.

Time seemed to pass slowly as she pondered if this was enough. Worried that if this didn’t bring her any benefits and instead meant she had wasted her time and money, she was about to turn around but her friends reassured her. Magdalena's gaze shifted to the three size pools of bubbling warm salt-water at 34 degrees Celsius, inviting her in and telling her to trust them. 

Another wave of apprehensions followed her, but only until her first session began. Moving slowly through the pool with her arms slowly drawing circles around her in the atmosphere of warm water and gentle resistance emboldened her to take further swims over the weeks that followed. Always reassurances to follow safety guidelines and directed towards the right pool – one of the three – according to her physical state.

The novelty of her swimming surroundings also played a role in how quickly Magdalena’s used to the rhythm and movements. The bubbly scent of salt and the decor of the pool welcomed her in, providing added comfort that would not have been available in any other environment.

After six consecutive weeks, Magadalena noticed clear improvements in her mental and physical stability, going from the reluctant water-fencier that entered to a confident swatschka, managing regular exercises to improve her mobility and coordination. She emerged from her Hydrotherapy experience as a freer, healthier version of herself and could attribute it to the safe but enjoyable experience hydrotherapy had provided her.

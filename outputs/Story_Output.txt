Theodore was one of the senior residents who had been living in a care home for the past ten years. He missed the days when he used to go for leisurely swims and that's why he had eagerly signed up for hydrotherapy sessions. Done in the comfort of a resident-friendly pool, the 0thers in the group were regulars and even had their own ‘swimming plan’. The warmed-up saline had the power to show you the ocean upon your first shore entry. It was the cruise of Theodore's life then, weightless and free: just an exercise in sailing to and ahoy in his mind.

Every two months for the past six weeks, Theodore had constructed enough balance to kick off the space and float in the protection of the pool. Time was suspended and moments rolled like life meant to be lived - free from the world. Theodore noticed that he had built up better straight technique, astounding broader motion and faster locomotive. 

Triumph was clear - the risks associated with grounds fall and sudden imbalance had been minimized. But the bliss reassurance of hydrotherapy to replenish stress sprang to his mind. Hydrotherapy remained Theodore’s only moment of solace, a journey immersed in movement and vigor to initiate long time stayed powers.

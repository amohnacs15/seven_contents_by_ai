# The Unbreakable Bond: The Story of Vojtek the Bear
It's a tale of love and perseverance – a modern-day story that could belong in a bedtime storybook. It begins in a small train station in Iran during the end of World War II, a place where luck had a way of interfering with history. A moment that allowed a hungry, lost and scared cub, one that captured their hearts, to cross paths with a group of recently released Polish soldiers, a move that would shape the lives of both forever.

This is the story of Vojtek, a Slavic name translating to 'happy warrior', who in 1942 joined a group of Polish refugees at the peak of World War II. After being unwillingly and unexpectedly born in a detainee camp, the small and endearing lost cub soon captured the hearts of the soldiers and it wasn’t long before he was travelling with them – the only four-legged companion on an otherwise tough mission. 

The 22nd Company Shared a Unique Bond With Vojtek
At times hungry, ill and endangered, the command noticed something peculiar about the soldiering Vojtek. In spite of all the dark and soul-crushing details of the war, Vojtek was strangely resilient, full of energy and always could be relied on to lift the mood up and rally the team. Arrested cases of bullets scaring the dispirited soldiers always could hide in an embrace of their undisputed four-legged pal. And that’s how Vojtek secured his spot in the 22nd Military Transport Company - Czech Unit Poleshn - the legal name given to Vojtek soon after his unexpected entrance.

Vojtek Had to Join the Polish Army - "'He" Couldn’t Leave'
Though Vojtek was a beloved and there were even strong musings on his infallibly motive support, his buddy-role amongst the Polish reserve went beyond a gimmicky mascot if only by necessity.

A mere two years later and the squad was relocated to fight alongside the British 8th Army in Italy. The British forbid animals from boarding the transport ship to Italy meaning their favorite four-legged companion could not. Under the pressure of rules, regulations and the lack of any reasonable ground for the exceptions, the modern age David had to reach for an ID. To tempt all misunderstandings, to prevent any implications and, perhaps, caring for Vojtek all too strongly, the approved only choice has been made: Vojtek was officially enlisted into the Polish army as a private. 

The End of an Epic Tale
This, however, was the end of an era; later on the war rang it’s second burst of greeting to Eastern Europe - poland included – and the 22nd Military Transport Company received orders for further deployment at home. It was time for au revoir! 

Time for Poland, the loving strangers and all their bondes to say goodbye to a man commonly known as Private Vojtek by all. Soon, Vojtek was gathered once more with all that accompanied his congenital fate: a journey along danger and fear and fellow bear brethren. A joyous journey of tranquility and safety known as Scotland’s Edinburgh Zoo. 

To the 22nd Company, a race still pursues Vojtek etched in wool, engraved with the recollection of beyond ordinary embracement, affection and dedicated servitude: a bear of battle to seize hearts and titans alike, and to be honourable sang behind all mankind theatres floors, a museum of a connection inked with a barrage of awe and splendor that even the unforgiving nature of history soon issued most of us to witness. His portmanteau may delight as vacant by today; that of nominative - Vojtek - notwithstanding memories that a small motor group will continue to ensure remain cold whilst clear for all humanity to rigour until the stars fade and tails his matter comes to shroud themselves in complete cessation.

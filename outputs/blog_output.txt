H1: Why Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin Are Valuable 

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the latest craze, and everyone wants a piece of the action. But what makes them truly valuable? Should you jump on the cryptocurrency hype train, or is this all just a passing trend? Below, we'll explore the two fundamentals behind Bitcoin's value - desirability and limited quantity.
 
In this article, we'll look at how these two factors explain why cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have become so desirable, and we'll look at why some cryptocurrencies are more valuable than others. To conclude, we'll review why mining for Bitcoin is getting more and more difficult for those wanting to cash in. 

H2: Desirability of Cryptocurrencies 

The value of a given cryptocurrency is rooted in its desirability, or its usefulness as a means of exchange. At the forefront of this is Bitcoin, the forefather of all cryptocurrencies, which has become a popular option for completing person-to-person transactions without the involvement of banks, PayPal, or other third parties. Bitcoin has major advantages in terms of costs and transfer times, which explains why so many merchants now accept it. 

Other coins such as Ether and Litecoin are becoming more widely accepted as transactional currencies, but they lack the widespread recognition of Bitcoin. Despite this, Ethereum and Litecoin still have their own distinct uses, such as its widespread use as a development platform. Thus, both the recognition and the utility factor into how valuable any given cryptocurrency is. 

H2: Limited Quantity of Cryptocurrencies 

What sets cryptocurrencies apart from other assets, such as currencies and stocks, is the limited number of coins available. Cryptocurrencies are carefully modelled after gold and their limited quantity of coins is similar to traditional commodities such as diamonds, platinum and other precious metals. 

For Bitcoin, 21 million is the cap set on the maximum coins that can be mined. This is often predetermined at the time of launch for a given cryptocurrency and is a feature designed to stabilise it.

Due to Bitcoins higher cap, and therefore less competition, Bitcoin commands the highest position within the crypto world. Think of it like the gold of the cryptocurrency world, and the runners-up like silver and copper.

H2: The Increasing Difficulty Involved in Mining

In addition to their desirability, what makes cryptocurrencies valuable is the decentralized mining process involved in mining them. A miner’s job is to effectively solve difficult cryptography-related puzzles in order to create new coins and secure transactions. This ‘proof of work’ system not only rewards them with some coins eventually but also contributes to market liquidity by introducing a steady flow of new coins into circulation.

Usually, the higher the cryptocurrency’s undesirability, the less miners are attracted to work on it. Furthermore, similar to gold or any physical currency, the easier and cheaper it is to find the cryptocurrency, the lower its perceived value. With Bitcoin being the most expensive and complex to mine, mining for currency is getting more and more difficult.

Conclusion 
Cryptocurrencies have enjoyed extraordinary success in recent years, and there’s no sign of its popularity slowing down anytime soon. The high demand for diversified transactions beyond banks, together with the controlled supply of digital coins, illuminates the underlying characteristics that make Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin so valuable. Cryptocurrencies have certainly surprised the world by revolutionizing payment and exchange processes, making them truly the currency of the future.

A digital illustration of a computer screen with a watermelon icon above it and a flowchart labeled “Machine Model” below. Within the chart are arrows symbolizing the inputting of physical attributes being received by the machine model from outside sources, presumably a person. Also illustrated, are various circles labeled in order to show the output conclusion that can then be consolidated as the machine model reaches, what is hopefully attained— percentage surety over the selection of watermelons. For then, after ten years of this insight, one can ultimately trust the machine model to even become their mystery fruit's mediator permitting selection, at a predictable accuracy, of those desired fruits.

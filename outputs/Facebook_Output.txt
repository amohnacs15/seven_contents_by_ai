Should you trust this machine? Machine learning is changing the way we think about food. For the first time, buyers can feel confident that the food on their plates is of the highest quality, instead of blindly trusting their instincts. 

At WatermelonFarmers, we're introducing long-term machine learning with our revolutionary model. Our model assesses your watermelons' fatness, thiness, and other attributes and stores user feedback over a 10 year period, so that ultimately you don't ever need to worry about the quality of your watermelons again. 

Imagine what food shopping will be like when you can be certain that you and your family are getting the best quality, without straining your health, time, or finances. 

Help us to bring this change in the food industry by liking, following, and sharing our Facebook page. Let's work together to ensure beneficial progression of machine learning in the food industry, now and in the future! #machinlearning #food #watermelonfarmers #thefutureisfood

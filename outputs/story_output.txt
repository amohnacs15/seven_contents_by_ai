Short Story:

For decades, Nolan had relied on manual methods to buy his watermelons. Using feeling and smell, it seemed that before whichever watermelon he bought, sadly, the choice was mostly guesswork. 

But then, after Years of Research and Development, science had finally found an answer an answer. On the side of the grocery store shelf were the machines with Machine Learning capabilities, using physical attributes and other data for analyzing the watermelon's traits. “Maybe this could serve as an answer to my watermelon dilemmas,” Nolan thought.

For the next Ten Years, he purchased the watermelons consistently and carefully fed the data from the purchased watermelons into the machine model. Watermelon by Watermelon, Nolan recorded whether he thought the watermelon had been good. Little by little, with Nolan’s consistent contribution, the Machine Learning model began to grow; able to approximate with percent surety which watermelon was good or bad. 

Nolan relished with satisfaction knowing he had been an integral part of this development that would serve him this. Now whenever he needs to buy watermelons, he confidently leans on the data already written into the model; finding belief that the machine’s model could help indentify good watermelons.

Bullet-Point List to Describe the Story Visually: 
- A groceserry shelf with watermelons on the shelves
- A person purchases the watermelon 
- A machine with Machine Learning capabillities 
- The machine's data capture and feeds it with physical attributes from the watermelons 
- Recording whether he thought the watermelon had been good
- The ML model beginning to grow 
- Person becoming ofuse of contributing towards the machine's model
- The person having the ability to trust the ML model for indentifying good watermelons

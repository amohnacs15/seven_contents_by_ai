It was during a desperate moment of WW2 that a small miracle happened. In 1942, a group of recently released Polish soldiers had stumbled upon a small and fierce bear cub at a train station in Iran.

The soldiers were in desperate need of a powerful spirit amongst them, and this wild little bear was to become their inspiration - they adopted him and named him Vojtek.

Whatever hardships war threw at them, Vojtek was a shining symbol of courage and hope that kept the soldiers going. 

Eventually, Vojtek was officially drafted into the Army to make the voyage home with the 22nd Company, a rank for which he momentarily gained the title â€˜Private'.

They began their journey back home, and were welcomed by an exiting celebration at the port in Poland. The people were glad to be reunited with their brave soldiers, and many didnt know what to think of Vojtek the bear standing proudly beside them.

Unfortunately, regulations of the port made it impossible for Vojtek to join the returning soldiers back home. Instead, they brought their small warrior of hope to its new home in the Edinburgh Zoo. 

As the years passed, Vojtek proved to become a very popular attraction, regularly visited by journalists, tourists, and more surprisingly - his companion former soldiers too.

Vojtek the Bear was an immense symbol of noble courage and showed that with will and spirit together humanity can come together, accomplishing the greatest feat in times of despair.  His story was an inspiring reminder of compassion -a reminder that will be kept alive forever.

 The relationship I have with Don is different from any of the other patients that I've took on. He's more of a down to earth person. He may be 90 years old, but he can fool you. He doesn't even act like 90. So it's easy to get along with him. We sit there and we enjoy his breakfast together and then from there we take another routine. We have something to do every day. We either go shopping, we go visit the coffee shop, we go see the donut shop. Every day Don and I have a plan. We go and have coffee with his buddies and that helps him communicate better as well as get out and about. And then we have our little errands that we go to the stores and I take him to the doctor and we go to the beach a lot and sit and just talk and watch the waves and the dog walkers. You need somebody to not be out of touch, let's put it that way, get a stay in touch. And that traveling out every day is important to get me out of the house. What is it like to work with people I am so close with? It's amazing. It makes my job a lot easier. It really does. It makes me wake up and look forward to every day. I think I elevate his spirit just by being here because when his wife was alive, his wife was here with him all the time and now she's gone and it's like he's leaving this big house by himself. And with him coming, I think that itself is just elevation. I think providing here for Don is very good for his health. Don is 90 but he's good. I mean his mind is really good. She's a big person in terms of personality and she kind of smothers you at times. He's a good guy. Like I say, he's my go-to guy. Without Don I don't know what I would do. You'd figure something out. He's a good little baby. He's a good little baby.

 Hi, my name is Abel and I'm one of the administrator of Newport Heights Manor and I'm also the wife of her, Bill De Los Santos. And today, I'm one of the caregiving team is to help the elderly to assist how to stand up. My model right now is Bill. His name is Bill and he's kind enough to be one of my model for today. Bill, are you ready? Yes. Okay. So, how to assist the elderly to stand up? First, you have to lock both of the wheelchair and then you have to stand up beside them and you have to put your feet apart. And make sure you put your right hand under his arm and you have to grab his pants with your left hand and then you have to tell him when you're ready to grab him. And make sure that you have your walker ready in front of him and you have to coordinate with him how to stand up. Bill, I'll come with you and when I count one, two, three, then that's the time you will stand up. And make sure your feet are parallel apart to each other so you have a support when you put him up. Okay, Bill, we're ready to stand up. One, two, three, up. No hard and it's safe for him. Ready to sit down? Good job, Bill. Thank you. So that's the caregiving tip for today.

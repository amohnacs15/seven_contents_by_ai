 Hi, we're Boomers Hub, and in this video we're going to give you a brief overview of what a caregiver is and the duties and responsibilities of a senior caregiver. A caregiver is someone who cares for a person who has special needs. However, there are other words that describe a caregiver's relationship with their charge. These include guardian, administrator, and conservator. The term custodian also can be used, but it refers to institutional settings, specifically such as nursing homes or hospitals, so this usage should be avoided when talking about older family members. Caregiving can be voluntary, a full-time or part-time job. A caregiver usually takes care of people who are ill, elderly, or physically challenged. Caregivers duties and responsibilities can vary each day, but it will significantly depend upon two factors. One, how much support person in care need. Two, relationship with the individual. Mostly, the caregivers are a family member or friends who offers non-medical assistance in the home. Though caregiving duties will change each day, some of the core caregiving responsibilities will be the same while caring for a senior loved one. In the role of a caregiver for the elderly, you can expect these duties pretty much every day. Want to learn more about caregivers? Check out our website at www.boomershub.com

 Did you know that aged care workers have a higher than average chance of being seriously injured at work? Did you know that most of these injuries are caused by incorrect manual handling practices? Working in residential aged care involves a unique set of risks and hazards. From the manual handling and moving of residents to dealing with behaviours of concern, your safety at work depends on your attitude and your understanding of the people in your care. By being aware of the hazards and understanding how to control the risks, injury and illness can be prevented. Everyone at work has a responsibility to ensure a safe workplace, and you can contribute by adopting a proactive attitude towards safety and by following the correct safe work procedures. The topics covered in this course are manual tasks, behaviours of concern and infection control.

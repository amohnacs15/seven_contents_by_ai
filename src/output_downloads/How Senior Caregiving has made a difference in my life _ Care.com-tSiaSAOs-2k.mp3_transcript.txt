 I've been stretched in many different directions. I've had a lot of struggles. I've been in Boston now for about five years, and when I first arrived, I had just gone through a divorce, and while I was going through the divorce, I also became unemployed. And at that point, I had to ask myself, what is within me? What can I do to support my family? And that's how I became a caregiver. My relationship with my grandparents was very special to me. When I thought about what I was going to do to support my own family, and I turned to caregiving, it was natural for me to also consider elder care. Nellie's daughter found me through care.com. We met, we had a conversation. She felt that I would be good for her mom, and I've been with Nell now for two and a half years. Hi, Nellie. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you doing today? And I just feel like I am making a difference in her life, not just her life. I know how much her family relies on me being there. I often do forget that I'm working. And it's not about the goal. It's about the bond that we form, the connection that we feel towards one another. To see her smile and laugh and know that she's enjoying her life. At 98 years old, she's enjoying her life.

 4:
The protagonist is walking along a path in the forest, the trees towering overhead. The path is winding and narrow, and the silence is oppressive. The only sound is the occasional chirp of a bird or the rustle of a leaf as the wind passes through the trees. The protagonistâ€™s steps are heavy, and her heart is heavy with sorrow.

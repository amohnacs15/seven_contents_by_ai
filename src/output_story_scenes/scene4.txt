The setting is a small cottage on the edge of the forest. The walls are made of wood and the roof is covered in moss. The windows are small and the door is slightly ajar. The two figures stand in the doorway, their faces still hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They enter the cottage and the darkness envelops them.

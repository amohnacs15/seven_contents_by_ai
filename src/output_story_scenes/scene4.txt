: The library.

Environment: The library is a large, open room with tall shelves filled with books. The walls are covered with paintings and photographs of famous authors and poets. The floor is wooden and the air is filled with the smell of old books.

People: There are several students sitting at the tables, studying and reading. A few librarians are helping students find the books they need and checking out books for them. At the back of the room, a group of elderly people are gathered around a table, discussing the books they just read.

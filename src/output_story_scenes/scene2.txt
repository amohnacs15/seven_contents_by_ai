 2:
The protagonist is walking slowly through the forest, her footsteps echoing in the silence. She is lost in her thoughts, not paying attention to her surroundings. As she walks, she passes by a small stream, the water trickling over the rocks, creating a soothing sound. She stops for a moment to take in the beauty of the nature around her, and her heart begins to fill with a sense of peace.

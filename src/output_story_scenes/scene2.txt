The setting is a forest on the outskirts of the town. The trees are tall and the air is filled with the sound of birds singing in the branches. The ground is covered in moss and fallen leaves, and the sun filters in through the canopy of leaves. The two figures are walking slowly along a path, their faces still hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They are silent, their footsteps muffled by the crunch of leaves beneath their feet.

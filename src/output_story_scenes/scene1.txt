: The playground.

Environment: The playground is situated in a small park at the end of a quiet street. The sun is shining brightly and the trees provide some shade from the heat. The playground has a small slide, a couple of swings, and a sandbox. The grass is neatly cut and the air is filled with the sound of children's laughter.

People: There are two children playing in the playground. One is a little girl wearing a pink dress and the other is a little boy wearing a blue shirt. They are both running around and playing tag with each other, giggling and having a great time.

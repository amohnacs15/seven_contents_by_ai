The scene begins in a small, run-down office in the middle of an urban neighborhood. The walls are painted a dull gray and the floor is covered in worn-out linoleum tiles. The only light in the room comes from a single window, through which a stream of sunlight pours in, casting a yellowish glow on the room. In the center of the room is a large, wooden desk with a single chair in front of it. Behind the desk sits a middle-aged man in a wrinkled dress shirt, his hands folded as he stares at the floor in deep thought.

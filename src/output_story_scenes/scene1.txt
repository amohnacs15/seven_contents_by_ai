: The protagonist's house 
Environment: The protagonist's house is a cozy single-story home, with a warm and inviting living room. The walls are a light blue and adorned with family photos and hand-crafted art pieces. The wooden floors creak as the protagonist walks across them. In the living room, there's an old, worn couch and an armchair, both covered in a faded floral print. The windows are lined with white curtains and are filled with natural light.

People: The protagonist is an elderly woman, with gray hair and a warm, kind face. She is wearing a light-blue cardigan over a white blouse, with a string of pearls around her neck. She is walking across the room slowly, her hands clasped in front of her.

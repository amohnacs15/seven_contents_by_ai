 1:
The protagonist, a young woman, is standing in a clearing in the middle of a dense forest. The trees are tall and thick, and the sunlight is barely able to filter through the canopy. A soft breeze rustles through the leaves, and the air is still and silent, with a feeling of melancholy hanging in the air. The protagonist is alone, her head bowed, her hands clasped in front of her. Her eyes are downcast, and her face is expressionless, as if she is deep in thought.

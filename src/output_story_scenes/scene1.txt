The main character, a young woman named Avery, is walking through a park on a sunny day. The park is full of lush green grass and tall trees, providing a shaded area for people to relax. There are various benches scattered around the park, and Avery takes a seat on one of them. She is wearing a light blue summer dress and sandals, and her long, dark brown hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She takes a deep breath and smiles, feeling the warmth of the sun on her skin.

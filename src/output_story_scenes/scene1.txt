The setting is a small town in the middle of nowhere. The sky is grey and gloomy, the air is dry and dusty. The streets are lined with old, run-down buildings that are in desperate need of repair. On one side of the street is a small shop, its windows are covered in cobwebs and the paint is peeling off the walls. Across the street is a dilapidated park, the grass is overgrown and the playground equipment is rusty and broken. Two figures stand in the middle of the street, their faces hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They are talking quietly, their voices muffled by the sound of the wind.

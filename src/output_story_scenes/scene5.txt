 5:
The protagonist is standing in a clearing, surrounded by tall trees. The air is still, and the sunlight is filtered through the leaves, creating a soft, dappled light. In the center of the clearing is a large, moss-covered boulder, and the protagonist sits down on it, feeling its coolness against her skin. She gazes out into the forest, her eyes distant and sad.

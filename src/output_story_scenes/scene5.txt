The setting is a bedroom inside the cottage. There is a single bed in the corner of the room, the sheets are rumpled and the mattress is sagging. The walls are bare and the floor is made of hardwood. The two figures stand in the middle of the room, their faces still hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They talk in hushed tones, their conversation filled with sadness and regret.

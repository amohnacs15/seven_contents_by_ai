: The library 
Environment: The library is an old and stately building, filled with stacks of books and the smell of old paper. The walls are adorned with paintings and photographs, and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The lights are dim, giving the room a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

People: The protagonist is sitting on one of the couches, her hands clasped in her lap. She is wearing a light-blue dress and a white sunhat, her face lit up with a gentle smile. She is quietly reading a book, her eyes scanning the pages as she turns them.

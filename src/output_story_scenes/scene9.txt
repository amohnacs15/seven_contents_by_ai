: The church 
Environment: The church is an old building, with a high ceiling and large stained-glass windows. The walls are lined with pews, and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The air is filled with the sound of the choir and the smell of incense.

People: The protagonist is sitting in one of the pews, her hands clasped in her lap. She is wearing a light-blue dress and a white sunhat, her face lit up with a gentle smile. She is listening to the choir and quietly praying, her eyes closed in prayer.

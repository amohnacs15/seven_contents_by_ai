The protagonist is walking through the forest, the trees towering overhead. The air is still, and the only sound is the rustling of the leaves as the wind passes through the trees. Suddenly, the silence is broken by the sound of a fox barking in the distance. The bark is loud and menacing, and it sends a chill down the protagonistâ€™s spine.

: The classroom.

Environment: The classroom is a large, airy room with large windows that let in plenty of natural light. The walls are decorated with posters and artwork that the students have created. The desks and chairs are arranged in a neat row and the floor is covered in carpeting.

People: The teacher is standing in the front of the room, lecturing to the students. The students are all paying attention, some taking notes while others are doodling in their notebooks. A few students have their heads down, either sleeping or daydreaming.

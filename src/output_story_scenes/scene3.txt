: The neighborhood park 
Environment: The neighborhood park is a small but vibrant green space, filled with trees, flowers, and benches. The air is filled with the sound of children playing and the scent of freshly-cut grass. There is a small pond in the center of the park, surrounded by a gazebo and picnic tables.

People: The protagonist is walking slowly around the park, her hands clasped behind her back. She is wearing a light-blue dress and a white sunhat, her face lit up with a gentle smile. She is silently admiring the beauty of the park, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells.

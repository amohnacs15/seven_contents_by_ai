The setting is a clearing in the middle of the forest. The sun is setting and the sky is painted in oranges and reds. The two figures stand in the middle of the clearing, their faces still hidden in the shadows of their hoods. One of them breaks the silence and speaks, their voice low and deep. They talk for a while, their conversation punctuated by occasional pauses and thoughtful silences.

The setting is the town square. The sun is setting and the sky is lit up in oranges and reds. The streets are filled with people, their voices ringing out in loud laughter and conversations. The two figures stand in the middle of the square, their faces still hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They make their way through the crowd, their steps slow and steady.

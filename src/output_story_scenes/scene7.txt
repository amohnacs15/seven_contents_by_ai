 7:
The protagonist is standing in a clearing, surrounded by tall trees. The air is still and the sunlight is filtered through the leaves, creating a soft, dappled light. In the center of the clearing is a small pond, its surface shimmering in the light. The protagonist kneels down by the pond and stares into the water, feeling a sense of loneliness and isolation.

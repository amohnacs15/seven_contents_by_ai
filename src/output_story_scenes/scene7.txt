The setting is a graveyard on the edge of the town. The air is filled with the scent of wildflowers and the sound of the wind rustling through the trees. The two figures stand in the middle of the graveyard, their faces still hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They kneel down in front of a gravestone, and one of them speaks a few words in a soft, reverent tone.

: The cafe 
Environment: The cafe is a small and cozy space, filled with the smell of freshly-brewed coffee and the sound of conversation. The walls are lined with old books and the floor is covered with a rug. There are a few small tables and chairs scattered around the room, and a counter with a coffee machine.

People: The protagonist is sitting at one of the tables, a cup of coffee in front of her. She is wearing a light-blue dress and a white sunhat, her hands clasped in front of her. She is quietly sipping her coffee, her eyes scanning the room as she takes in the atmosphere.

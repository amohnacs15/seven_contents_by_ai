Scene 1
The scene begins in a small, run-down office in the middle of an urban neighborhood. The walls are painted a dull gray and the floor is covered in worn-out linoleum tiles. The only light in the room comes from a single window, through which a stream of sunlight pours in, casting a yellowish glow on the room. In the center of the room is a large, wooden desk with a single chair in front of it. Behind the desk sits a middle-aged man in a wrinkled dress shirt, his hands folded as he stares at the floor in deep thought.

Scene 2
The man looks up as the door to the office swings open, revealing a young woman in her mid-20s. She is wearing a bright blue dress and a pair of white sneakers. Her hair is pulled back in a messy bun, and her dark eyes scan the room as she takes in her surroundings. She looks nervously around the room before finally making eye contact with the man behind the desk.

Scene 3
The man behind the desk breaks the silence between them, his voice a low rumble. He introduces himself as the owner of the office and informs the woman that he is looking for someone to help him with a project he is working on. He goes on to explain that the project involves gathering data from the neighborhood and that he is willing to pay her a fair wage for her efforts.

Scene 4
The woman takes a moment to consider the man’s offer before finally agreeing to take on the job. He thanks her and explains that the job will involve going door-to-door to collect data from the people living in the neighborhood. He hands her a stack of papers with instructions and then directs her to the first house on the list.

Scene 5
The woman steps out of the office and into the neighborhood, squinting as the bright sunlight greets her. She takes in her surroundings, noting the run-down houses and the litter-strewn streets. She begins walking towards the first house on the list, her steps echoing off of the pavement.

Scene 6
The woman knocks on the door of the first house on the list, and a moment later she is greeted by an elderly woman. The woman invites her inside, gesturing for her to take a seat in the living room. The woman notices that the room is sparsely decorated, with only a few pieces of old furniture and a single plant in the corner.

Scene 7
The elderly woman begins to tell the woman about the neighborhood, her voice soft and kind. She speaks of the people who used to live in the area, of the businesses that used to thrive here. As she speaks, the woman takes notes on the papers she was given, writing down the woman’s stories.

Scene 8
After a few hours, the woman leaves the house and continues to the next one on the list. As she walks, she takes in her surroundings, noting the changes in the neighborhood over the years. She passes by a park, noting the children playing on the swings and the elderly couple walking hand-in-hand.

Scene 9
The woman knocks on the door of the next house, and is greeted by a young couple. They invite her inside, and the woman notices that the house is filled with the couple’s belongings. The walls are adorned with photos of the couple’s trips abroad, and the shelves are filled with books and knick-knacks.

Scene 10
The couple tells the woman about the neighborhood, their voices a mix of enthusiasm and nostalgia. They talk about the changes in the area since they moved in, and the woman takes notes as they speak. After a few hours, the woman thanks them for their time and leaves, her stack of papers filled with stories of the neighborhood.

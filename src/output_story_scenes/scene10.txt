The protagonist is standing in a clearing, surrounded by tall trees. The air is still, and the only sound is the rustling of the leaves as the wind passes through the trees. In the center of the clearing is a large, ancient tree, its branches reaching up to the sky. The protagonist stands and gazes up at the tree, feeling a sense of awe and wonder.

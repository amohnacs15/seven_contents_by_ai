: The beach 
Environment: The beach is a tranquil place, filled with the sound of waves crashing against the shore. The sand is soft and white, and the sun is shining brightly in the sky. The air is filled with the scent of salt and the sound of seagulls.

People: The protagonist is standing at the edge of the shore, her hands clasped in front of her. She is wearing a light-blue dress and a white sunhat, her face lit up with a gentle smile. She is silently admiring the beauty of the ocean, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells.

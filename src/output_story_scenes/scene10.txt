 Ten: A large, open area with several people wearing lab coats. They are standing around a long, metal table, which is covered with various tools and equipment. In the center of the table is a single chair, and a woman in a black hooded cloak sits in the chair, her eyes closed and her hands clasped together in a strange, almost ritualistic pose.

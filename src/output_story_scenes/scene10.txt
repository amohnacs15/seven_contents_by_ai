: The park at night.

Environment: The park at night is a peaceful, quiet place. The stars are shining brightly in the night sky and the trees are swaying gently in the breeze. The streetlights provide some light and the air is filled with the sounds of crickets chirping.

People: There are a few people walking around the park at night. Some are couples enjoying a romantic stroll, while others are lone figures walking alone. A group of teenagers is gathered at one corner, laughing and joking.

: The post office 
Environment: The post office is filled with people, the sound of chatter filling the air. The walls are lined with a variety of mailboxes and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. There are lines of people waiting to be helped, and the smell of freshly-printed stamps.

People: The protagonist is standing in line, quietly observing the people around her. She is wearing a light-blue dress and a white sunhat, her hands clasped in front of her. She is patiently waiting her turn, her eyes scanning the walls as she waits.

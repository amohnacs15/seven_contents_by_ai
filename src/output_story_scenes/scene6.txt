The setting is a small kitchen in the cottage. The walls are lined with shelves filled with jars of herbs and spices, and the air is filled with the smell of freshly-baked bread. In the center of the room is a wooden table, and two chairs are pulled up close to it. The two figures sit across from each other, their faces still hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They talk in hushed tones, their conversation filled with warmth and understanding.

# Understanding Home Healthcare in Medicare Plans 

Are you on Medicare looking to take advantage of home healthcare services? Many seniors can benefit from the support and care that home health services provide, but you may at first be confused as to what is covered and what isn't. In this blog post we will examine the available home healthcare services covered by Medicare and give an overview of healthcare options when Medicare does not provide coverage. 

## What Home Healthcare is Available with Medicare? 

Medicare provides covered home health services to homebound seniors who wish to receive nursing and/or therapy services in the comfort of their own home. It is necessary to schedule a face-to-face doctor's visit to certify these services are need and the coverage must be renewed every 60 days. Personal care aids such as assistance with dressing and bathing may also be covered, but it's important to note that Medicare will not cover homemaker services such as cleaning and cooking. To receive coverage, Medicare eligible seniors must hire a certified home health care agency and they can easily do this by logging onto the Medicare website. On the other hand, if they have a Medicare Advantage Health plan they must contact their own plan. 

## Options When Medicare is Not an Option

For those not eligible for Medicare, there may still be some home health care options available. Long-term Care Insurance and some life Insurance insurance policies may provide some coverage. For veterans, they may qualify for the Veteranâ€™s Directed Care program and the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). For those with limited income, services funded by Medicare or SoonerCare may be another option. 

For those who are on original Medicare, they may find a Medicare certified home healthcare agency by calling 1-800-633-4227 or by going to their website, kfor.com/forseniors. Medicine.gov or Jim's website - SavvySenior.org - may also be worthy resources to explore services available in your area.

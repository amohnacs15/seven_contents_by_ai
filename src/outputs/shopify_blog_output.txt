United Dimensions offers a powerful monitoring system equipped with a bevy of specialized sensors to safeguard the health of elderly loved ones and provide greater peace of mind. 

## Detecting Heart Rate, Breathing, and Movement

Omnisensing technology works to detect crucial pieces of information medically, like heart rate, breathing, and movement. Through this data, Omnisensing is designed to detect any shift in pattern or changes in between that could suggest an emergency situation. The best part is, no video surveillance or protected personal data is used during production, as modulations in room acoustics alert the included receivers when any of the specified changes occur. Brilliantly underrated, the transmitters' mechanisms sense and filter patterns to detect medically relevant components of an elderly person’s normal activity.

# Understanding What Medicare Home Health Coverage Includes 

Are you a senior looking for information on home health care coverage? If so, Jim from Savvy Senior can help! Jim has been discussing home health care resources available to seniors and what options individuals with Medicare have. Of these options is Medicare home health coverage, which provides care to those with certain medical needs in the comfort of their own homes. In this blog post, we will dive into the specifics of Medicare home health coverage and what it entails.

## Rights & Additional Benefits

If you are a Medicare enrollee in need of home health coverage, understand that you have rights when recruiting in-home help. You may make any arrangements for home health services that you see fit as long as a healthcare provider certifies that you are in need of either skilled nursing care or specialist-level therapy services. In some cases, a doctor must consider your living situation, in which case you must be limited in your ability to leave your home. In addition, you may select a certified home health care agency, need to participate in face-to-face program to certify care requirements, and will be subject to renewal services every 60 days. 

## Medicare Coverage & Different Alternatives

It is important to note that home health care offered through Medicare covers occupational and physical therapy services, as well as skilled nursing activities and medical social services needed. However, it does not include physician services or homemaker services like cleaning, grocery shopping, and cooking. 

Should you still have coverage needs after exhausting Medicare home health services, other options are available. There are long-term care insurance policies, life insurance policies, PACE programs (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), and medical services meant to assist those living at low-incomes, provided either through Medicare and SoonerCare services. Furthermore, veterans benefit from coverage through the Aid & Attendance benefit and Veterans Directed Care program.

Working as an aged care worker can be exceptionally rewarding - but it carries a unique set of risks as well. Thatâ€™s why we created this invaluable training course. It helps workers to understand the risks specific to their environments, encouraging them to take timely, thoughtful steps to provide care without sacrificing their safety. We emphasize topics such as proper manual handling techniques, behavior management, and infection prevention. This course helps aged care workers to proactively prevent illness, injury, and dangerous scenarios. #agedcare #caregivers #aidworkers #physicalinjury #safeandsupportive #manualhandling #behaviormanagement #infectionprevention

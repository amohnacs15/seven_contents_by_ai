Accessing the resources needed to receive #MedicareHomeHealthCare coverage can be overwhelming and complicated. Is it covered? What resources are available? What eligibility criteria are there? @SavvySenior Jim is here to provide clarity on these questions and outline the different ways to get help and support. Per Medicare, anyone needing skilled care and verifiably homebound (meaning, difficulty in leaving their home) is eligible. The agency performing those services must be certified by Medicare, and meetings and renewals must occur every 60 days. Plus, additional programs like #LongTermCare insurance and #VeteransDirectedCare could provide access to other services for those that donâ€™t qualify for Medicare. To refine these options and learn more, call 1-800-633-4227 or visit Medicare.gov & ForSeniors or @SavvySenior!

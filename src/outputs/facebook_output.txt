Caring for seniors with adequate home health care is more important now than ever before. All too often, those over 65 find themselves needing medical care from home, but not meeting the necessary requirements to be deemed homebound and receive coverage under Medicare. It can feel disheartening and lead to illness, along with detrimental financial circumstances for struggling families. #Awareness #Empathy #Seniors 

Thankfully, Jim is striving to shed light on options for seniors and those who cannot qualify for Medicare benefits, such as long-term care insurance, the PACE program, veterans care, and the aid and attendance homebound allowance for veterans. If a lower income level is the issue, Medicare and SoonerCare waive community-based service fees to afford seniors home health care possibilities. #UrbanVsSuburban #CareForAllSeniors

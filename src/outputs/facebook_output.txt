Let's come together and support aged care workers, who have to put themselves in a higher risk position simply to help care for our older generations. Everyday, these heroes are exposed to physical injury on the job. There are manual tasks for handling, behavior challenges to manage, and infection prevention must be practiced -- all so that the elderly in their care can feel safe. We cannot allow these people to take their positions for granted anymore; we must recognize the bravery required of their roles and collectively ensure that they are well provided for. # protects our aged care workers #prevent injured work #agedcarehero #supportagecare

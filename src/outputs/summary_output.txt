Family Caregivers BC defines a family caregiver as someone who offers care and support to those living with disability, frailty or disease because of aging. In BC 8% of its population varies loyal caregivers – that’s around 1.37 million people in British Columbia, and much bigger number across Canada. The duties of a caregiver are both determined by the one area care and support from the person providing the care. Every hour of care given by a professional, 90% is done by the caregivers. 

To be a elderly caregiver Rosalind Carter provides a beautiful quote, “There are four kinds of people in this world, those who've been caregivers, those who are caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will have a caregiver." It takes kind, resilient and patient people to fill such a spirit caring role. 

Caregivers must keep up with the daily activities that require cognitive and physical care; giving support with daily living, transporting and accompaniment, providing emotional support and filling in the general well being of the care recipient. Caregivers are met with which included overload experienced from coping with multiple life changes and needing connection with others, some find self care to manage their energy and taking a pause from adult situations to not only care for those in need, but for those needs for those tending to the lives. Support can come from the circle of care created; help manage roles and tasks from family, friends and local organizations. 

With Family Caregivers of BC, resources are available to help better understand and congregate appointments for the general benefit of the caregivers and individuals needs being cared for.

This text speaks to the nuance of caregiving and the ups and downs associated with it—from the relationship building aspect to resulting physical and mental health issues. Our executive director Barb McLean states that caregiving is an experience that is often significantly life-changing, but might also accumulate hardships on the caregivers' mental and physical health. Caring is something driven by the relationships between two people, and whether one serves a caregiver or the receiver of that care, one can expect to be on both sides of this during a lifespan. Research reveals often poor physical and mental health effects resulting from caregiving including chronic health conditions, immune system concerns, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and physical injuries. The biggest challenge for many caregivers is often related to excessive workload, resulting in isolation, difficulty setting boundaries, and neglecting taking on necessary for help or support from family or friends. To aid growing caregivers and care receivers, DC can help them identify their boundaries and the extent of care that works for their situation and aids conversation related to that with their partner, family, and healthcare workers. This text stares us in the eye to appreciate the everyday difficulties related to caregiving and reinforce that it is something far too important to not take seriously.

Caregiving can involve a lot of complex family dynamics that can make it a stressful and challenging role, including different levels of contribution from family members. There can also be a feeling of lack of support from family and friends, as well as from healthcare providers, which can add to stress. Grief, loss, and financial and legal implications are further issues involved in caregiving. Oftentimes, caregivers can be forced to stop working in order to provide care, resulting in financial changes. Navigating the healthcare system can be difficult, which is why support is available to help caregivers feel seen and heard. Isolation is a common outcome of caregiving, and it is easy for caregivers to prioritize the needs of those they are caring for over themselves. Signs of caregiver stress can include denial, anger, social withdrawal, anxiety, depression, exhaustion, inability to sleep, emotional reactions, and difficulty concentrating. In working with caregivers, identifying these signs is an important step towards helping them put resources and tools in place that can help alleviate the stress.

The organization this text is discussing works with caregivers to evaluate their needs and bolster their network of support. They do this in various ways, including one-on-one coaching and virtual or in-person support groups. Additionally, they engage in creative activities with caregivers to help them blow off some steam. Before engaging any of these supports, they emphasize the importance of recognizing what specific challenges the caregiver is facing and making a list of those items during the warm-up period. This is integral to seeking out meaningful help. Additionally, they encourage caregivers to create an individualized support plan tailored to their specific needs. This plan should focus on being engaged, informed and forming active plans to manage their own needs. By planning ahead, a caregiver can find space for aspects like healthcare. Having a plan also lessens stress and allows for better time management. It should be noted that there is no template or structure that each caregiver should be bound to, but there are a lot of tips for creating a successful support plan in the organization’s learning center.

Caregivers must plan for their care when providing care for another person. Through better communication and planning, caregivers can make sure their own needs are also being met. Caregivers experience a multi-dimensional effect from their caregiving role as it influences their physical, intellectual, spiritual, emotional, environmental and social wellness. As a physically and emotionally exhaustive role, caregivers usually enjoy a decrease in their physical and emotional health if they spend too long providing care. To counter hyp balance, caregivers can connect to friend groups, support groups and pleasurable activities so they can return to caregiving with renewed energy. Connecting to family and friends can be beneficial when needing aid, but it is important to be able to tend to your own needs first. The fourchallenges that regularly come up in caregiving surveys are absence of connection, feeling unsupported, unappreciated, and a lack of help with taking care of themselves. Caregivers must take the initiative to reach out for the help they need in order to be the best caregiver they can be.

Caregiving is not something that can easily be done alone and takes a support system in order to manage demands within the role. Being a caregiver can can lead to isolation as they do not make time to find respite, take a break, or be with family and friends, thus leading to decline in their own well-being. We, at Family Caregivers of DC, help caregivers build a “circle of care” which is a support system of reliable people who will help them survive through the experience while providing their care recipient with the best care. This system originally reduces the demands on the health care system when the caregiver and care recipient remain in isolation. Additionally, a circle of care helps to address the isolation experienced by caregivers, allowing for greater socializing or at least provide a six being off in the form of weekly coffee break refreshers. The support system increases the quality of care for the caregiver and in turn also increases the quality of care for the care recipient.

When caregivers are looking to build a circle of care for those they are caring for, there are certain steps at the beginning that need to be taken in order to ensure success. These steps include pinpointing needs and setting boundaries – e.g. understanding what is outside of your abilities as a caregiver. Once a list is formed for what help is needed, one is then tasked with looking at their community, who can be relied on for help and/or asked anyone from family and friends. Asking may feel daunting, but people will more likely than not be willing to help - it’s a good rule of thumb to think “if I were helping someone else in a similar situation I would want to be asked.” The last step is understanding the value of keeping that circle active and alive, staying connected, and frequently reaching out.

This text is about the importance of strong relationships as a caregiver. It explains how there are four different circles of relationships that are important for caregivers. The first circle is the circle of intimacy, which is typically made up of two spouses (regardless of whether one is the caregiver or care recipient). The second circle of relationship is the circle of friendship, which consists of friends and relatives that could offer the caregiver some respite. The third circle is the circle of participation, which are organizations and associations that the caregiver can take part in or have memberships to. The fourth and final circle is that of paid support, which includes services such as paid care aides and therapists who can give care and support to the caregiver and their care recipient. The hope is that caregivers are constantly thinking about and growing their circle of interactions, so that their support system is ever-expanding and strengthening.

Circle of Care is a process that helps caregivers take care of themselves by building a team of people around them who can offer emotional and practical assistance. A facilitator can be appointed to train and provide resources and guidance on how to ask for help, prioritize tasks, and ensure people are providing meaningful emotional and practical assistance. As a caregiver, arranging delivery services, planning meals instead of cooking them and added extras like lawn care/snow removal or ordering groceries can all be critical in allowing a caregiver to take care of themselves. The importance of validating those who provide this assistance, while making sure they are reminding people that they still need it is also highlighted. Finally, allowing caregivers to stay connected to those they are helping before, during and after they provide the care, is a goal of the program and is something very beneficial.

Family Caregivers of BC offer various advice and resources for caregivers in the form of individual one-to-one conversations, assessments, and webinar resources to name a few. They encourage caregivers to make connections and fight isolation by providing support and strength. They understand that connection is when people feel seen, heard, and valued, and when they can give and receive without judgement. To address this need they offer a variety of services through their learning center, caregiver support line, along with a reading library with articles, newsletters, podcasts, and live video webinars. Their goal is to provide each and every caregiver with with the necessary advice and guidance tailored to their individual situations. If there is any questions or further information needed for those in the caregiver lifestyle, Family Caregivers are ready and eager to listen.

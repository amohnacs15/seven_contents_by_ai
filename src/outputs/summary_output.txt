The role of a caregiver in a family is a crucial one – someone that serves to help those in need and show therapeutic comfort. This role is often taken on by different members of a family, based on a variety of factors including geographical proximity, age and marital status. While mothers generally fulfill the role due to alternative ’double days’ of childrearing and breadwinning, fathers, sisters, brothers, grandparents and even close friends can all become precursors to the ideal caregiver. Caregivers can take on a myriad of responsibilities such as tutoring children, helping aging parents or citizens in a community and providing essential meals during times of domestic unrest. Without a doubt, caregiving is a significant responsibility and demands serious consideration when formulating the behavioral pattern in a family.

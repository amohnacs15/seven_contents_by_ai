Boomers Hub is here to provide a brief overview of the duties and responsibilities of a senior caregiver â€“ someone who looks after someone else with special needs. Such family members or people whose relationships are close to the individual can volunteer to give non-medical aid in the care of an elderly person or an ill, or physically-challenged individual. They can take full-time or part-time jobs in this field. These caregivers often have the burden of adapting their caregiving duties per the individual's needs. Everyday, they have certain responsibilities to fulfill, like preparing meals, making appointed rounds to the doctor, hygiene, safety and many others. They must also ensure that basic amenities like toiletries, clothes, and other floor walks (if needed) are taken care of so that the senior remains as independent as possible. However, some basic duties remain the same such as providing companionship, emotional care and offering help in emotional, social, physical and medical care.

Caregiving can be demanding and lead to stress, fatigue, and a neglect in personal health. For example, the caregiver often develops sciatica from lifting the patient might not be able to go for their own health testing. If the caregiver decides to be a caregiver by themselves, eventually they will reach a breaking point of “I can’t do this anymore” and turn to hotlines for help. Therefore, caretakers are highly encouraged to ask for help before reaching such a breaking point. To make this request for help easier for friends and family, the caregiver should list out specific and short tasks to help with (e.g. picking up laundry, delivering food, taking the patient to an appointment). Opportunities for help may be resistant from the patient (“I only trust my daughter and don’t want anybody else here”). There are still creative ways to summon help such as having the caretaker ask the patient for a “personal assistant” to run errands. This strategy may then lead to additional support outside of daily errands, such as helping with bathing the patient.

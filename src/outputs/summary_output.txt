In order to receive home health services that are covered by Medicare, the individual must meet certain requirements; a healthcare provider must verify that the individual needs either skilled nursing care or skilled therapy services and the individual needs to be considered homebound, meaning it is significantly challenging for them to leave the home. Furthermore, they must choose and hire a home health care agency that is certified with Medicare and must have face-to-face meetings to ascertain care needs in order to renew certifications every 60 days. Medicare may cover occupational therapy services and personal care aid services (help with dressing, bathing, and so on) but won’t cover homemaker services like shopping, cooking, or cleaning.

Jim from ‘Savvy Senior’ has been discussing options for obtaining home health care coverage and available resources for people in need. If a person does not qualify for Medicare home health coverage, there are other options. These include long-term care insurance policies and life insurance policies, as well as PACE programs (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) and low-income services provided by Medicare and SoonerCare. For veterans, there are two programs available with the aid of Allowance Homebound and Veterans Directed Care. Furthermore, those with Medicare can locate a Medicare certified home health agency by calling 1-800-633-4227 or by visiting Medicare.gov, with additional information available at kfor.com/forseniors or savvysenior.org.

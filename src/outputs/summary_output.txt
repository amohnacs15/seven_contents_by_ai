The text discussed requirements for home health care and the kind of services Medicare covers. To have home health care covered under Medicare, the patient must be certified by a doctor that they are homebound and need skilled nursing care or therapy treatments. Beyond this, Medicare also covers occupational and personal care treatments as needed. These treatments must be recertified by a doctor every 60 days to ensure coverage remains. The process for hiring a home health care agency certified with Medicare can be found through the Medicare website and those with Medicare Advantage plans must contact their plan to verify coverage. However, there are particular caveats, such as Medicare not covering homemaker services and the requirements of needing skilled nursing care or therapy services in order to receive coverage for personal care aids.

Jim is an advocate seeking to provide healthcare to seniors through various options. He explains that while Medicare provides home health coverage, those who don't qualify may consider other resources such as long-term care insurance, the PACE program, veterans care, and the aid and attendance homebound allowance for veterans. Additionally, lower incomes may access financial services for home health care through a Medicare or SoonerCare twist called community-based service waivers. Information on finding a Medicare certified home health agency can be found at Medicare.gov or KFOR.com/Forseniors, as well as details at SavvySenior.org.

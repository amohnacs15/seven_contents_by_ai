Home health services are a valuable Medicare benefit that can help seniors get the care and support they need—but it may not be easy for seniors to understand these services and whether or not they are covered by Medicare. In order to receive coverage, seniors must be considered "homebound" and have a face-to-face meeting with a doctor in order to certify they need either nursing or therapy services. The doctor can also order occupational therapy and personal care aids such as help with bathing, dressing, etc. The coverage must be renewed every 60 days and it is important to note that Medicare will not cover homemaker services such as cooking and cleaning. Patients must hire a certified home health care agency and it is easy to do by logging onto the Medicare website. If an individual has Medicare Advantage, they must contact their own plan to lease what types of home health care are available.

Jim is here to provide information about home healthcare options when Medicare does not provide coverage. He mentions long-term care insurance and life insurance policies, which may provide some coverage, as well as programs like the Veteran’s Directed Care program and the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). Those income eligible may qualify for services funded through the Medicare or SoonerCare community-based service waivers. For those on original Medicare, they may locate a Medicare certified home health agency by calling 1-800-633-4227.

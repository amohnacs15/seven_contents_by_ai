This text focuses on five important safety guidelines that are important for caregivers to follow, both in health care provider roles and in caring for loved ones in the home. The first guideline is to be aware of your environment, including the locations of the nearest hospital, emergency services and family members, as well as any suspicious activity that may be present. The second guideline is to provide a safe environment by taking notice of any potential tripping hazards, that could be caused by pets, as well asadequate lighting. Following the safety guidelines established by your agency are also very important. The third guideline is to properly lift, stretch and turn people in order to protect your back from potential injury. The fourth guideline is to be aware of needle sticks or blood-borne pathogen exposure, and dispose of these items in the designated andapproved containers to assist in community safety. Finally, number five is to be mindful of fatigue that caregivers may be suffering, due to exceeding the limits of their role, which can potentially cause major harm to their mental and physical states. Following these five guidelines allows caregivers to ensure their safety as well as that of the patient or loved one they are attending to.

The text highlights the important of self-care for caregivers. Despite taking care of others, caregivers should not forget to make sure they are also taking care of themselves. Poor self-care often leads to illness and exhaustion due to the stress brought about by the job of caring for someone else. It is thus very important for caregivers to find ways to reduce stress and be mindful of their own needs. Furthermore, caregivers should ensure they get help with heavy lifting tasks and should accept respite when offered, as this will ultimately benefit the person the caregiver is looking after, as if the caregiver's own health deteriorates, so too will their ability to provide care.

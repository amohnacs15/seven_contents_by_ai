More and more families are turning to alternative structures, with grandparents, uncles, and aunts also providing an important and nurturant family environment; however, one constant throughout all of these arrangements remains – the caregiver role. Whether recognized tacitly or explicitly, the caregiver will commonly be a family unit’s core member, and must juggle a large range of responsibilities such as grocery shopping, meal times and assisting with activities of daily living; performing family caregiver education and training; leaving substitute caregivers upon departure; intervening rapidly in any medical emergencies; monitoring medication and health habits; advocating for the well-being of family members; and providing emotional support during stressful and difficult times. Navigating this difficult task requires not only organization, but skill and emotional fortitude, traits which caregivers should remember to invest in themselves, so to ensure long-term success. Ultimately, it is this caregiver that ensures that family schemas are healthy and well balanced, living environments become a source of strength rather than drain income, and conflicts remain constructive instead of destructive, therefore maintaining social integration, adapted communication skills and safe learning and living environments.

Boomers Hub presents an overview of what it means to be a caregiver for seniors and the duties required. A caregiver is someone who provides care for those who have special needs, and the terms for this relationship can range from guardian, conservator, and administrator, depending on the situation. Care may be voluntary or submitted as a job description, and will depend on the individual’s need for assistance or the relationship between caregiver and patient. Caregivers provide non-medical help in a person’s home, with tasks that may change on a day-to-day basis, but always contain core responsibilities. In the case of an elderly person, caregivers typically provide general and everyday care, such as daily meals, although this can also include additional specific requirements.

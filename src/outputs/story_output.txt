When Eli, a home-care aide, first stepped into his new role, he quickly learned how important it was to take care of himself in order to take care of others. With the five safety guidelines in mind, his awareness of his environment heightened and he made sure to keep the nearest hospital and emergency services close. He noticed the little tripping hazards and modified the home to keep the elderly woman he was tending to safe. If a needle stick or blood-borne pathogen were ever exposed, Eli would carefully dispose these items. And when his body began to fatigue, he followed protocol, took correct respite and kept up with his own wellness practices in order for his patient to thrive and for Eli to keep logging on for more days of successful care.

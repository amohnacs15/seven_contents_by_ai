Marian just celebrated her 90th birthday and she was feeling an immense pleasure and contentment - surrounded by her three children, nine grandchildren and even five great-grandchildren. With age, though, comes the need of some extra help in everyday tasks. She needed a companion in her lifetime journey, knowing her children and grandchildren are now busy with their professional duties.

That was the moment when Bailee crossed her life embracing her offer to provide emotional and physical care to Marian. Bailee connected with Marian since the first day. Never underestimating her experience, intelligence and thoughts. Listening to her stories, Bailee cooked for her, kept the house tidy and still had plenty of energy and quality time just for them. They told each other stories and secrets, creating a trusting and caring bond.

Later that summer, Bailee drove Marian everywhere, to her special basketball team event, to the theatre or simply just to the local library to share recommend. It was the ultimate comfort and understanding. Marian often looked at Bailee saying "I'm so lucky to have someone like you". Not only a carer but a real companion in her almost century long journey.

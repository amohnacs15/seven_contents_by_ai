Kathleen was working hard to expand her job as a caregiver, doing everything she could without getting overwhelmed or neglecting her own health. Instead of approaching her task from a transactional view, she gradually formed a close bond with her elderly client and encouraged their relationship to blossom until she was able even to provide personal care. Kathleen's willingness to open her heart to her client was key in her long-term success, helping her to make the once difficult tasks easier, even as she continued to balance her professional role and her own needs. Through Kathleen's creative approach, caregiving now looks a little brighter and more feaasble.

Mary recently moved back in with her elderly father to take care of him. With her dad beginning to be dealing with a lot of financial stress, Mary frantically searched trying desperately to find the right health care options to ease the financial burden of home care.

Suddenly, out of the corner of her eye, Mary noticed a figure walking down the street. His shirt flashed “Senior Home Care Expert” across the back in bold print. He smiled amicably at Mary as he introduced himself and inquired if he could help her. Once he had heard her family’s story and situation, he was able to easily explain the various types of services that would be covered under Medicare—and those services that did not qualify.

He told Mary about lifesaving options like the Veteran’s Directed Care program and the Programs for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) just to name a few. He closed off their brief visit mentioning visiting the Medicare website and his very own website, SavvySenior.org for more information.

Mary was filled with relief as the expert left, with newfound information that opened up more options for her pressure--pressed father. Mary definitely agreed it had been a god-send of a day.

Linda had recently been deemed "homebound" due to a persistent health issue that significantly made it challenging for her to leave her home. She knew she was in need of coverage for home health services, and her only option was Medicare - but she knew practically nothing about the requirements and processes for it.

Unwilling to give up, Linda stumbled upon an article by activist group "Savvy Senior" regarding the different resources and services available to those in need of home health care. She quickly called the toll-free number provided, and learned about each service available for her. 

Thanks to the help of Savvy Senior, Linda found not just what kind of coverage she could receive through Medicare, but also income-based services, military performance enhancement programs, and long-term care insurance and life insurance policies if she were unable to qualify for Medicare.

Most importantly, Linda found accessible support and information when she felt no other options were available - and thanks to programâ€™s reliable resources, she was finally able to meet her needs and ultimately her goal of getting the much needed resource of home health services.

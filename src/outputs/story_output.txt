Maggie was a lifelong caregiver, devoted to caring for others in need. She started as an assistant nurse aiding a variety of people in need, until she got a special request. She was asked to take on a position of a sworn adult guardian of a elderly gentleman in need of serious regular care.

Before her first visit at the gentleman’s household there was a doubt in her mind, whether she would be able to handle it all?

On her first day, she opened the gate to a beautiful garden, with a tiny little white house at its heart. When the elderly gentleman kindly welcomed her in, she was flooded with warmth, charm and laughter filling up the air. Maggie realized that her duties were more than just cleaning and preparing meals. She needed to nurture and become a companion for the elderly man, in charge of all his worrisome needs. Ensuring his safety, companionship and devoting attention to every issue he might have – was key to provide a perfect care.

Before long time, the little house (and its surrounding) was buzzing - almost humungous. Both he and Maggie were tenderly blossoming enjoying the simple pleasure good conversations and adventures each and every day.

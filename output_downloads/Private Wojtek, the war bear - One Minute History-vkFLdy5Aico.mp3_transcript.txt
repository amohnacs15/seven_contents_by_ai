 In 1942, a recently released group of Polish soldiers stumbled across a stray bear cub in an Iranian train station. Captivated by the bear's personality, they decided to take him in as their own. They later donated the bear to a nearby unit known as the 22nd Company. The unit named him Vojtek, a Slavic name translating to happy warrior. The bear quickly assimilated with soldiers, learning how to drink coffee and even salute when greeted. In 1944, the unit was reassigned to fight alongside the British Eighth Army, but British transport ship regulations prohibited animals from travelling on board. To get around this, Vojtek was officially drafted into the Polish Army as a private. When World War II ended in 1945, Vojtek was given to Edinburgh Zoo, where he lived out his life, visited by journalists, tourists and his fellow soldiers.

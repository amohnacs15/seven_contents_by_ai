 This is Joe. Joe is retired and lives alone. He's about to turn 70. He's had a fulfilling career teaching the fifth grade to thousands of children. When Joe was young, he picked up smoking. He also developed type 2 diabetes, putting him at a three-fold increased risk of having a stroke. Unfortunately, Joe will have his first stroke this afternoon. It starts with a headache and he takes an aspirin. Then he has trouble seeing things clearly in the room. He gets up again to get a glass of water. He falls to the ground and is frozen from the stroke. Seven hours go by before his daughter walks in to find her father. It's too late to apply TPA, a therapy that must be applied promptly to be affected. 800,000 people have a stroke every year in the United States. Yet only 10% of people make it to the hospital in time for life-saving therapy. The remainder of stroke survivors are left with chronic disability. This is where Alva Health's continuous stroke monitor comes in. Using two wristbands, the device detects when there is abnormal weakness on only one side of the body, a defining signature of stroke, and immediately notifies the user and their emergency contacts. Alva Health's continuous stroke monitor is positioned to dramatically improve the lives of millions of patients and their families and to save the healthcare system's significant resources.

 Exercise underwater is another option. Using the benefits of water to support your weight during your workout will reduce the pressure on your joints and increase flexible mobility. So today we will be introducing you to Hydro therapy. Body degeneration in elders affects their balance, which puts them at risk of falling. Reports have shown that one third of elders over 65 years of age fall every year. Falling can lead to hip fractures and in worst cases can put their lives at risk. Exercising underwater is a good exercising alternative, which will help improve your balance using the benefits of water to strengthen your leg muscles. The buoyancy force will support half of your body weight, ease pressure on your knees and reduce the risks of falling compared to exercising on ground, as the viscosity of water is supporting your body. There are three types of swimming pools specifically used for hydrotherapy. The smaller sized pool includes jet massage and bubbles to help you relax, as well as adding resistance to your workout. The medium sized pool is suitable for those who need to practice individually, including those who are experiencing hydrophobia or having difficulties balancing themselves. A larger sized pool is suitable for elders, especially those who have balance difficulties. This pool is also suitable for those who experience aching as well as those who are paralyzed. Hydrotherapy takes no longer than 45 minutes. Swimming pools that are used for hydrotherapy are salt water pools, where the temperature is usually around 32 to 34 degrees Celsius. Studies have shown that elders can balance themselves even better after practicing hydrotherapy for six weeks. On the next episode, we'll be showing you more exercising techniques that you can do it yourself. Sawasdee ka.

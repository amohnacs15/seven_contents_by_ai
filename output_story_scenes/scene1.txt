The scene opens on a small, rural town in the middle of nowhere. The sun is setting, casting a golden hue over the landscape. The streets are empty, save for a few people walking their dogs or taking a stroll. The mood is peaceful and tranquil, with a hint of anticipation in the air. The sky is a deep blue, with a few wispy clouds scattered across it. The air is still and the only sound is the occasional chirp of a bird.

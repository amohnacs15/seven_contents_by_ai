The scene shifts to a small, run-down house on the outskirts of town. The windows are boarded up and the paint is peeling off the walls. The yard is overgrown with weeds and the porch is littered with trash. The mood is one of despair and hopelessness. The air is heavy and oppressive, and the only sound is the occasional creak of the house as it settles.

In this text, the author wishes to create a sci-fi prompt generator using AI and GPT-3. The text then digs deeper into the concept of fine-tuning a model, which involves giving GPT-3 a new set of instructions for a specific task. Here, the specific task is creating movie scripts, although the principles of fine-tuning a model can be applied to activities like language learning.

To create a sci-fi mid-journey prompt, they create a few-shot prompt which includes a small story about the singularity in the style of George Orwell, specific sci-fi styles like vector art, inspiration from movies such as Blade Runner and The Matrix, sci-fi artists such as H. R. Geiger and Chris Foss, and a specified aspect ratio of 3 by 2. Once these instructions are given to GPT-3, it produces a prompt – leaving Earth, exploring unknown galaxies, Star Wars style, pixel art in the style of Chris – which is compared to what was created initially as a baseline.

In this text, the author is discussing a data set that they are creating to fine tune machine learning models connected to the possibility of humanity leaving Earth. The data set is created by a Python script which produces 250 examples, which are transformed into separate prompts and completions by another script. After the JSON file is created, they send it over to OpenAI where the fine tuning process can take place, taking 12 hours to complete. After the fine tuning is done, the testing is run through a playground where the model can be picked and manipulated. The script saves time in the sense that less input is needed compared to manual processes.

The text above discusses the process of creating a mid-journey prompt with artificial intelligence (AI). Initially, the goal was to form a prompt surrounding AI itself and its potential dangers, such as Singularity and AI Going Rogue. Though typically a prompt of such detail and specifics is desired, the form eventually turned to providing prompts surrounding popular Sci-Fi franchises, Matrix versus Darth Vader as well as Star Trek and Humans vs AI cybernetic capabilities. After laying down the basics for the prompts, the document moves onto one of the major aspects that come when working with AI, the varying degrees and cost of functioning with different levels and range. This ranges from the free chat engine options available, comparison of Human to Computer power (i.e Blade Runner Style) , and comparison of Chat GPT and Davinci 3. In the end, the comparison of formulas is said to have cost the person in the text $55 the previous day, which is seen questionable to the cost the project.

This text looks at whether fine tuning models is worth the cost, discussing a specific example where 1.5 million tokens were used with 250 examples. It is pointed out that while Davinci is a cheaper option, the usage cost is also expensive - costing 12 cents per thousand tokens where DV is 0.02 cents. The text then gives a comparison of images using Chat GPT and a fine tune model - prompting the reader to decide which image looks best. In the example presented, the reader finds that Chat GPT's version of the left image looks better, but in terms of pixel art the one from the fine tune model looks more appealing. To conclude, the text suggests that while fine tuning models can be expensive, it may be worth considering when used in certain contexts - such as creating pixel art.

In this experiment, various results were obtained by comparing Future of Humans and Compute Power. The model generated images nearest to the fine tuning one, are highly boring and bland in comparison to the one obtained from Chat GPT. This other one is inspired by the biomechanical art style of the famous artist Chris Foss and has the cyberpunk style associated with Blade Runner. Although fine tuning gives detailed results, one should take care because it is expensive and not always needed. The pricing of fine tuning is important to keep in mind. This experiment was a fun experience and may help viewers who want to explore generative AI further - for this, there is a link in the description of a Youtube membership which provides members only videos and other fascinating material. In conclusion, it might be advised to not "go crazy on the fine tuning" but instead keep an eye on pricing as well as the cyberpunk style appealing to many, found usually in Blade Runner.

# Exploring GPT-3, Mid-Journey and AI Image Generators
AI image generators, such as mid-journey or stable diffusion are a great way to combine the elements of sci-fi with the creative power of Generative AI. This blog post explores the combination of GPT-3 and Mid-Journey AI Generators, with a focus on fine-tuning models with GPT-3. First, we'll take a look at what fine-tuning is, and how to create data sets for fine tuning. We'll also explore the pricing aspect when using GPT-3 and mid-journey, and finally, compare the results for a few promts using both Chat GPT and GPT-3 fine-tuned models. 

## Understanding Fine-Tuning with GPT-3

Fine-tuning is a type of machine learning done to ensure that GPT-3 is more adept for the particular task at hand. Unlike general "tuning", fine-tuning can teach GPT-3 to mimick the writing or creative style of certain movies, series or authors. To accomplish this, GPT-3 must be provided with examples of such works. A good example of fine-tuning could be creating GPT-3 to generate movie scripts similar to ones written by George Orwell. For this, a data set composed of Orwell's past written movie scripts must be compiled and GPT-3 must be instructed to understand each example and write similar scripts in the future. Fine-tuning GPT-3 is essential when users want specifically designed outputs, correct down-to-the-detail stylings or accurate imitation of past scriptwriting.

## Practical Example of Fine-Tuning

For this practical example, we will take a few-shot prompt that was used to create data sets for a fine-tuned GPT-3, and create a Sci-Fi mid-journey prompt. The example contains a small story story about the singularity in the style of George Orwell, a "styles" equal vector art, 'inspiration' equal like Blade Runner style and Matrix style, a few sci-fi artists (e.g. HR Giger, Syd Mead, Chris Fox), a 3:2 aspect ratio, and instructions to produce a mid-journey prompt about this. 

Then, using a Python algorithm run 250 times will create a dataset for the fine tune model. After the experience is converted into a JSON file, the finishing step is to send it over to OpenAI for the model to be fine-tuned.  After time spent studying the dataset, a summary to conclude the experiment takes place, beginning with the elephant in the room: pricing. Before checking results, it can be seen that DaVinci calls for a usage of 12 cents for every thousand words.

## Results of our Fine-Tuned Model Experiment

With 250 results, fine-tuning might seem like a difficult finish and often not worth the amount of cost or testing involved. Through rigorous studying if both Chat GPT and GPT-3 fine-tuned models highlighted through the next three prompts, the results can be discussed. For the Matrix vs. Darth Vader nexus, both images recieved similar results, however Chat GPT had the slight edge in art they way they evenly split the image in two. On the other hand, the Future of Humans and Compute Power recieved drastically different outputs. In this instance, the output from Chat GPT resonated more, despite being a bit strange - notably due to the unique biomechanical style.

Overall, through careful observation, it can be concluded that Chat GPT has the edge over GPT-3 fine-tuned models, using specific styles for a few chosen occasions - particular pertaining to the more eclyptical projects. However, pricing deites many individuals from using this specific type of AI. There are precious use cases for fine-tuning, and though it may appear it is not recommend due to the unseen results and high costs, applications like this arise to leverage a user's own projects or scenarios. 

# Conclussion:

Generative AI has powered its way into the entertainment industry, enabling the possibility to create 'images that can tell our stories'. With GPT-3's fine-tuned form, it is possible to intermediate exploration into the AI-assisted artistic world - particularly in the Sci-Fi content. Through our example, it is possible to set up a certain model - culminating multiple creative styles to formulate aPromptsoutputs according to a user's demands. 

Though the cost of fine-tuning might not trump a creator's choice of media application, it can be heavily reliant on the type of imagery or the purpose of a project and ultimately highlight
